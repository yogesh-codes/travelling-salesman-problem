#Learning about TSP

## What is TSP

the proposed question is "Given a list of cities, as well as the distances bw each of the cities, what would be the shortest travel path such that we reach all nodes exactly once and get back to origin."

We do not have any 'exact algorithm'. Until today, we settle for heuristics.
